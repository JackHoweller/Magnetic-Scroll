Add scroll snapping to your site using:
`magneticScroll()`

To limit to a specific platform, you can use:

- `magneticScroll("Mobile")` for mobile-only, or

- `magneticScroll("Desktop")` for desktop-only

The package will automatically look for sections (or lack-there-of) in your HTML body and set up the correct parent-child relationships in CSS for scroll snapping.
